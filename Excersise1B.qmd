#### Define the variables

the Mean:

```{r}
mu=10
mean<-mu
mean
```
The Variance:

```{r}
variance=mu+mu^2*2
variance

```
#### Variable in line
The variance and the mean can be calculated with the formula variance= mean+mean^2*dispersion. By using the Formula with a mean of `r mean` and a dispersion of 2 we obtain for the variance `r variance`.


#### Define the negative binomial distribution to x1

```{r}
x1 <- rnbinom(100, mu = 10, size = 2)
```

#### Create a histogram

```{r}
h1<-hist(x1, main= paste("Histogramm of negative binomia-distribution"), col="lightblue")
```

#### Log Transformation

```{r}
log_x1<- log10(x1+1)
h2<-hist(log_x1, main= paste("Histogramm of negative binomia-distribution (log)"), col="lightpink")

```
